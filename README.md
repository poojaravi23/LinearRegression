# LinearRegression
Train a model via Linear Regression

Programming Language:
	Python 3

The program:
	1. Train a model via linear regression
	2. Using the trained model do the classification on the test data
	3. Calculate the best N value to choose for N-fold cross validation

Result: 
	1. The output will show the best N value for the (N-fold) and the accuracy received using that fold.
	2. The beta value, predicted y value for each of the test using that fold are also displayed.
